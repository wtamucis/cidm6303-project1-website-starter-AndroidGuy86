  <p>
    I've been skating for about 25 years and I still look forward to it the same way I did when I was a
    kid. <b>Skateboarding</b> has a way of doing that — it's one of those things that just stays with you.
    The shop carries the gear I actually use and trust, stuff I've tried out or that people I skate with
    have recommended over the years. Nothing gets on the wall just to fill space. If I wouldn't put it on
    my own board, I'm probably not going to sell it to you either.
  </p>

  <p>
    We stock everything you need to build a complete — decks in a range of sizes, a few different truck
    options, wheels for street and cruising, bearings, hardware, and safety gear. I try to keep the
    selection focused rather than overwhelming. Too many choices and you spend 45 minutes staring at wheels
    when you could be skating. If you're not sure what size or setup is right for you, just ask. I've
    helped beginners figure out their first board and helped longtime skaters dial in something more
    specific — either way works.
  </p>

  <p>
    The shop also just ends up being a place where people hang out, which I didn't plan but I'm not
    complaining about. Skaters stop in after a session, grab a coffee, talk about what they landed or
    what they're working on. If you're new to skating and feeling a little unsure about walking into a
    skate shop, don't sweat it. This is a pretty laid-back room and nobody's going to give you a hard time
    for being a beginner. Everyone started somewhere.
