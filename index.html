  <p>
    <b>Grind & Glide</b> is a neighborhood space built on two timeless cultures: coffee and skateboarding.
    We believe great ideas are born over espresso and sharpened on concrete. Our shop blends the energy
    of a skate spot with the comfort of a café, creating a place where creativity, caffeine, and community
    meet naturally.
  </p>

  <p>
    Skate culture has always been about independence, expression, and persistence. Coffee culture is no
    different. Both reward patience, practice, and appreciation of craft. At Grind & Glide, we roast our
    beans with intention and curate our skate gear with the same care.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you’re stopping in for a pour-over, tuning a board, or just looking for a place to sit and
    think, our shop is designed to slow you down just enough to enjoy the moment.
