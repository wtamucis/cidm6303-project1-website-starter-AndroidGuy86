  <p>
    <b>Grind & Glide</b> started because I got tired of choosing between a good cup of coffee and a place
    where I actually wanted to hang out. I've been skating since I was a teenager and got into home roasting
    about ten years back, and at some point it just made sense to put the two things together. This shop is
    what came out of that. It's nothing fancy — just good coffee, good gear, and good people coming through
    the door most days.
  </p>

  <p>
    We carry boards and hardware that I'd actually put on my own setup, and we pull shots on equipment that
    I spent way too long researching. Neither side of the shop is an afterthought. I take the coffee seriously
    and I take the skate stuff seriously, but I try not to take myself too seriously — there's enough of that
    going around. If you come in not knowing much about either thing, that's totally fine. We're happy to
    talk through it without making you feel like you're behind.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most mornings you'll find me behind the bar or out back waxing something. Stop in, grab a drink, poke
    around the decks. If you just want to sit quietly with a latte and your phone, that's cool too. No
    pressure, no dress code, no attitude. Just a neighborhood shop that happens to smell like espresso and
    fresh grip tape.
